Style Guide
===================

Writing code for addons-server? Awesome! Please help keep our code readable by,
whenever possible, adhering to these style conventions.

We recently adapted the `black code style <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style.html>`_ so that we encourage you to set up your editor to stick to these standards or to run `make run-black` before you commit.
